### Connect to the API
Copy this entrypoint URL

If you're not experienced in connecting to an API you can use 3rd party programs like [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to pass the parameters to the server.

More information about connecting to an API with postman can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5n07Ybz7yI&t=31s).
